The struct macro is used as a short hand for defining objects used
exclusively for quick access to it's members. It is used by passing a
set of name/value mappings like so:

foo := struct(something: 3, other: getMeSomeOtherObject());

The above code will make foo into an object of a type with two
members. The first member will be of type Int and the second will be
of the return type of the getMeSomeOtherObject function. The something
member will have an initial value of 3, and the other member will have
the return value of getMeSomeOtherObject as its value.

Struct values can be any Anna expression, including another struct.

The struct type macro is used for creating simple classes aimed for data storage.
Basically, a struct type behaves exactly like a regular class, but with a few additional abilities.

<p>
The struct type macro is used for creating simple classes aimed for data storage.
Basically, a struct type behaves exactly like a regular class, but with a few additional abilities.</p>

<p>These are:

<ul>
  <li>A suitable constructor is automatically created, that accepts one argument for each member of the struct.</li>
  <li>__cmp__, hashCode and toString methods are all created, doing what you would expect them to.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Usage example:
</p>
<pre class="anna-code">
struct MyStruct
{
    var Int some;
    var String other;
}

...
// A constructor is implicitly created for struct:s.
vv := MyStruct(some: 3, other: "abc");
vv2 := MyStruct(5, "");

// This prints MyStruct(some: 5, other:);
print(vv2);
</pre>
<p>
Because structs implement the __cmp__ and hashCode methods, they can be used as 
keys in dictionaries.
